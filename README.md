# Bikeshare-Final Project
## Arianna Foo

### Abstract
My project evaluated the BikeShare dataset to predict the number of bike rentals based on various factors such as weather, temperature and season. The dataset used feature engineering to transform categorical variables such as season, yr (year), mnth (month), hr (hour), weekday and weathersit. To determine the best-performing model based on cross-validation metrics, multiple regression models were trained and evaluated. The results showed that linear regression was the best-performing model as it captured the relationship between the features and the bike rental count by providing high accuracy and strong predictions. The projects highlight the compatibility of using Liner Regression for large and complicated datasets like BikeShare to underline efficiency and accuracy in managing datasets.
